- **ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Iuliia Mazur**

**Data Analyst**

- Data analytics is a profession that I plan to pursue in great detail and with utmost dedication. I appreciate how analytics aids in making decisions based on numbers rather than opinions. I completed an 8-month data analytics training course, and now I am continuously honing my skills by reading books on analysis and statistics. 

- I have always believed that before making any claims or assumptions confidently, it's essential to back them up with data and numbers. Analyzing the data, identifying patterns, establishing correlations, and visualizing the information in a way that is understandable to anyone are crucial steps in this process.
Analytics possesses the gift of persuasion and is highly devoid of subjective feelings. Through it, one can constructively and productively discuss work outcomes, make plans, and forecast the future.

**Skills and tools:**
Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Plotly, cohort analysis, unit economy, product metrics, A/B testing, testing of statistical hypotheses, SQL
